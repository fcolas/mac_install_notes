If python is installed with brew (for instance as a dependency) but you want to stick to the system python, you might run into trouble with easy_install and pip

Remove brew python:
$ brew uninstall python

Reinstall distribute (for easy_install):
$ wget http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py
$ sudo python distribute_setup.py

Reinstall pip:
$ sudo easy_install pip
